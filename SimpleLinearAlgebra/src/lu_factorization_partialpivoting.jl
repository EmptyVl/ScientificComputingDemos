LU factoriazation (or Gaussian elimination) with row pivoting is defined as PA = LU, where P is a permutation matrix.
L is a lower triangular matrix, and U is an upper triangular matrix.
Pivoting in Gaussian elimination is the process of selecting a pivot element in a matrix and then using it to eliminate other elements in the same column or row. 
The pivot element is chosen as the largest absolute value in the column, and its row is swapped with the row containing the current element being eliminated if necessary. 
This is done to avoid division by zero or numerical instability, and to ensure that the elimination process proceeds smoothly.
